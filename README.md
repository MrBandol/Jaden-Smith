# Jaden-Smith-ONGOING-
A program where you can enter any String of text and it will capitalize the first letter of every word. "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Are Not Real"

Day 1 : Got the base of the project almost done, pretty late in my area so I will continue tomorrow, and I might learn Swing just for the UI stuff.
Day 2 : Completely Re-did the code and made another one, this time instead of using HashMaps, I used ArrayLists, and made the code a lot more clean.
        Added a Generate Jaden Smith Quote Button for now, in which it would just print out the array of quotes, that's it for today.
